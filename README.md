      <h2>About this Project</h2>
      <p>This project is centered about the idea that digital signage shouldn't be expensive or difficult to use, and by using Python as a backend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the frontend, it can be improved apon by anyone who would like. This software can throretically be used with as many screens (displays, signboards, or whatever you want to call them) as you want. However, it does require a computationally-beefy PC to run the managment software, an 3rd-gen i5 or similar is recommneded for best results, as the server will be used to compile a video that will be played by the screens. </p>
